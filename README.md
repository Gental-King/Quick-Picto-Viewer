<h1>Quick Picto Viewer</h1>

<h2>To keep the development going, <a href="https://www.paypal.me/MariusSucan/10">please donate</a> using PayPal.</h2>

<p>This is an image viewer based on GDI+. It can open: .dib, .tif, .tiff, .emf, .wmf, .rle, .png, .bmp, .gif, .jpeg files.</p>

<p>QPV is also able to create image slideshows and cache very large dynamic lists of files. Unlike other applications of this kind, it can load, on my system, a list of 500000 files on my system in under 10 seconds, while XnView Classic or Irfan View need more than 15 minutes.</p>
